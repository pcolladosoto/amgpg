# An Apple Mail Extension for using GPG

## Useful facts
Given the extension is containerised for now, we need to:

    # Move to the container directory...
    $ cd ~/Library/Containers/pcolladosoto.sampleProj.sampleMailExtension/Data/keyrings

    # Make the necessary directories and whatnot
    $ mkdir keyrings
